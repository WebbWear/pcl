My Capstone project is to solve a communication problem and be able to automated all reminders with my limo company. I need for drivers to login and all the information about the upcoming job is in one place. From the clients address, phone number, list of pickup locations, what clients preferences are and an explanation on how to operate all the electronics onboard the limo. I also need to have a login home screen for clients as well. The calendar will be available on the home screen so they can request days that are available and to automate the confirmation one day before the scheduled pickup for both client and driver.

This portal will also be a way for drivers to leave pertinent information such as vehicle milage in and out. Clients can leave special requests for their night out. This will save me a lot of time, from going back and forth with clients and drivers.
