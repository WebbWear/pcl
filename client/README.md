My Capstone project is to solve a communication problem and be able to automated all reminders with my limo company. The client side UI is build in React and the admin/driver side UI is built using Ruby on Rails. Drivers login and all the information about the upcoming job is in one place. From the clients address, phone number, list of pickup locations, what clients preferences are and an explanation on how to operate all the electronics onboard the limo. I also have a seperate UI built in React for clients to login. The React calendar will be available on the home screen so they can request days that are available and to automate the confirmation one day before the scheduled pickup for both client and driver.

This portal will also be a way for drivers to leave pertinent information such as vehicle milage and hours worked. Clients can leave special requests for their night out. This information will be stored in in PostgreSQL.
